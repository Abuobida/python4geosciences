Homework 1:

* There is a range of how people did on a quick look at the homeworks
* General notes:

 * start early! The homework is meant to take time. This is where a lot of your learning can take place.
 * starting early also gives you a chance to ask questions along the way when I still have time to help you.
 * work together.

* We'll have an extra homework session today or tomorrow — I will email after class with the time and place. I can't accommodate everyone, so please let me know if you can actually make it to part of the times listed too. [Doodle poll]( http://doodle.com/poll/ysm6x4by9wpbu4up)


Homework 2

* Pushed back because of this extra homework session to next Thursday.
* Just note that this further decouples when we are talking about the material with when the homework is due — but you should be working on the homework as we go through the material anyway.


## 9/15/16:

* hw1 is now due Tuesday September 20th and hw2 is due Tuesday September 27th. The syllabus in this repo has been updated to show this.
* When working on the homework, be sure not to change the notebook cells that tell you how many points a question is and include the tests for the code you wrote. These cells will be overwritten when I grade the homework with the original content, so anything you put in them will disappear. Additionally, they will impact your ability to use the "Validate" button to check your homework. I will fix the next homework assignment to mark these more obviously.
* If you have already changed one of these cells, get another copy of the homework and copy and paste in the original content to see if it will stop complaining about the change. Your changes will not impact my grading of the notebook once the cell contents have been replaced by the system.
