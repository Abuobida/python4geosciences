# Announcements

## 11/1/16:

* I sent out a doodle poll last night where grad students can sign up for when they will present on their project. If you are presenting as a group, sign into the doodle poll together.
* If you are in College Station, you will need to have your notebook presentation finished and shared with me somehow so you can present from my computer over Blackboard Collaborate. If you are in Galveston, you should be able to take control of the software and present through your own laptop.
* Let me know if you need me to add Python packages to copano.


## 10/18/16:

* hw3 and hw4 feedback available
* hw5 due this Thursday, and there are two more regular hws after that (hw6, hw7)
* For the end of the semester, the undergrads will have hw8, due Dec. 1st which will be a smaller version of the graduate student project, but without a presentation.
* Grad students will have their projects due Dec. 1st and 6th, when they present them in class.
 * Grad students can work together, but will present for 10 minutes per person in the presentation.
* For both undergrads and grads:
 * Choose an interesting dataset to analyze in depth
 * Your focus may be on the data in particular, while diving a bit into a python package or two, or it may be on a python package in particular, with some data.
 * Create a high-quality Jupyter notebook to write up your project. It should be laid out like a report with headers, it should be nice-looking, and it should seamlessly integrate writing and code to explain what you have worked on. Be creative.
  * Grad students: You should present this notebook in class (not additional slides)
 * Undergrads will submit this; graduate students will present in class and receive feedback.
 * All students will attend the presentations on the last two days of class and give feedback as part of their grade
 * Email me your idea for your hw8/project by Tuesday November 8th.
 * Undergrads: Explain the dataset and/or package you are using, then read in the data, and make and present 3-5 interesting plots.
 * Graduate students: Explain the dataset and/or packages you are using, then, per person, make 6-8 interesting plots that investigate something in the data/code. This should be enough material to discuss for 10 minutes/person.
 * Remember that we are a general audience that is connected by Python, so should data in a general-interest way and talk about the code you use, too.


## 10/4/16:

* hw2 feedback is available now
* do not use `pandas` on hw3

## 9/29/16:

* If you are struggling with the basics in this class, consider taking some or all of the [Code Academy class in Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). It is free online and is interactive so it is another way for you to get feedback on your code.
* hw2 due tonight at midnight. You can always submit more than once, so make sure you submit before midnight for sure!
* hw3 should be available tomorrow. I'm looking into making the homework assignments shorter and due every Thursday night, so the syllabus will be changing accordingly.
* Since we are taking class time to work on the homework, you should go through the materials on your own as well.
* We'll continue on `matplotlib` today and whatever we don't get to in the materials, you should especially go through on your own!


## 9/27/16:

Feedback from your homework is available on copano. Login to the server and go to the `feedback` directory. Click through to a homework notebook and open it. You'll see the html unrendered. A workaround to this is to alter the url. You will see in the browser address that it says `edit` somewhere, and you want to change this to `files` in order to see the html nicely rendered. Or, from something like:

https://copano.tamu.edu:8000/user/pythontest/edit/feedback/hw1/partA.html

to:

https://copano.tamu.edu:8000/user/pythontest/files/feedback/hw1/partA.html


These files will then show your overall points, points for each problem, and potentially comments from me for anything I needed to manually grade or look at.


## 9/22/16:

Homework 1:

* There is a range of how people did on a quick look at the homeworks
* General notes:

 * start early! The homework is meant to take time. This is where a lot of your learning can take place.
 * starting early also gives you a chance to ask questions along the way when I still have time to help you.
 * work together.

* We'll have an extra homework session today or tomorrow — I will email after class with the time and place. I can't accommodate everyone, so please let me know if you can actually make it to part of the times listed too. [Doodle poll]( http://doodle.com/poll/ysm6x4by9wpbu4up)


Homework 2

* Pushed back because of this extra homework session to next Thursday.
* Just note that this further decouples when we are talking about the material with when the homework is due — but you should be working on the homework as we go through the material anyway.


## 9/15/16:

* hw1 is now due Tuesday September 20th and hw2 is due Tuesday September 27th. The syllabus in this repo has been updated to show this.
* When working on the homework, be sure not to change the notebook cells that tell you how many points a question is and include the tests for the code you wrote. These cells will be overwritten when I grade the homework with the original content, so anything you put in them will disappear. Additionally, they will impact your ability to use the "Validate" button to check your homework. I will fix the next homework assignment to mark these more obviously.
* If you have already changed one of these cells, get another copy of the homework and copy and paste in the original content to see if it will stop complaining about the change. Your changes will not impact my grading of the notebook once the cell contents have been replaced by the system.
