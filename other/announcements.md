## 9/15/16:

* hw1 is now due Tuesday September 20th and hw2 is due Tuesday September 27th. The syllabus in this repo has been updated to show this.
* When working on the homework, be sure not to change the notebook cells that tell you how many points a question is and include the tests for the code you wrote. These cells will be overwritten when I grade the homework with the original content, so anything you put in them will disappear. Additionally, they will impact your ability to use the "Validate" button to check your homework. I will fix the next homework assignment to mark these more obviously.
* If you have already changed one of these cells, get another copy of the homework and copy and paste in the original content to see if it will stop complaining about the change. Your changes will not impact my grading of the notebook once the cell contents have been replaced by the system.
