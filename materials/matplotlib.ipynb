    "The setup for `contour` and `contourf` are similar: both take in structured x, y arrays with Z information to plot in two dimensions. However, while `pcolor` plots boxes of data, `contourf` groups together similarly-sized data for plotting. `contour` plots isolines, which have equal values along the lines (like contours on a terrain map). Also, `contour` and `contourf` assume that the input x, y locations give the location of the datapoint itself, as opposed to the edges of a box in `pcolor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful optional inputs include N, the number of bins of data to use (default 10); V, a sequence of values at which to plot; colors, a string or tuple of color inputs to use for the contours; cmap, a colormap instance to use instead of the colors; and levels, where you can specify the actual levels to use in the contours. There is an option to input `vmin` and `vmax` like in `pcolor` but this typically doesn't work as intended â€” it's better to use `levels` instead.\n",
